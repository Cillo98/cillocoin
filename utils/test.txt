FIRST TEST

2 + 2 Nodes

In first net a node mines with 1 thread
In second net a node mines with 2 treads

After a couple of block differences, the two nets are connected by connecting
a mining node to a non-mining node (because why not)

*** Status of the blockchain before merging

NET 1
Nodes 1 and 2 have 46 blocks each. Some transactions between the nodes happened

NET 2
Nodes 3 and 4 have 41 blocks each. Some transactions between the nodes happened

The two blockchains have different block hash values. Connection is between node 2 and node 3 (2 was non-mining, 3 mined few blocks)
